Place the following files here:

emailSubject.txt:		Put the subject title on the first line

emailBody.txt:			Fill in the email body in this file. Put the words that change depending on who we are emailing in parentheses - "{" and "}" - Do not format it yourself, the program will take care of it (see example).

emailBodyFormatting.txt:	Format each line beginning with the replacement word, including parentheses, followed by one space, an equals sign, a space, then a list of all possible values in quotation marks with a single comma between each option (see emailBodyFormatting.txt example).

recipients.csv:			A spreadsheet with all email addresses. Please put each email in column A, with each email address in a different row (i.e. A1, A2, A3, A4, etc...). If asked when exporting as a .csv, select "Unicode (UTF-8)" as the character set.
